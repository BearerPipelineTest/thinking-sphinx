## Installing Sphinx on Linux

Your best bet is to use the precompiled binaries available [on Sphinx's website](http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads/current/) - especially if you're using a v3.x release of Sphinx.

Most Linux package managers do have Sphinx available as a pre-built package, though sometimes their versions may be a bit old. For Debian and Ubuntu, the package name is `sphinxsearch`. Gentoo's portage has it available as just `sphinx`.

The source for the v3 releases of Sphinx is not available, but [compiling Sphinx v2.2.11 yourself](/thinking-sphinx/{{page.gem_version}}/installing_sphinx.html#compiling) is an option if you'd prefer to use that.
