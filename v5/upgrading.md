## Upgrading Thinking Sphinx

The [release notes](https://github.com/pat/thinking-sphinx/releases) on GitHub are a good source for what notable changes have occured in each release - and especially breaking changes.

If you're using a version of Thinking Sphinx older than v4, please refer to [older documentation](../v4/upgrading.html).

The breaking changes since v4.x are:

* Sphinx 2.1 is no longer supported. You must use Sphinx 2.2.11 or newer.
* Ruby 2.3 (or older) is no longer supported. Arguably the code may still work in older Ruby versions, but it's only tested against 2.4+.
* Rails 4.1 (and older) is no longer supported. Arguably the code may still work in older Rails versions, but it's only tested against 4.2+.
