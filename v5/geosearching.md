## Geo-Searching

One of the neat features of Sphinx is the ability to sort and filter by a calculated geographical distance, from latitude and longitude values. It's quite easy to get set up, as well.

### Setting up the Indexes

Firstly, you'll need to be storing latitude and longitude values as attributes for each relevant document. So, in your index definition, you'll need something like this, if you've already got the columns in your model:

{% highlight ruby %}
has latitude, longitude
{% endhighlight %}

You can name your attributes to be whatever you like - Thinking Sphinx will automatically use them if they're called latitude, longitude, lat or lng.

Keep in mind, though, that Sphinx needs these values to be **floats**, and tracking positions by **radians** instead of degrees.

#### Real-time Indices

For real-time indices, if you're using degrees in your database you'll want to have the conversion to radians happening in your model:

{% highlight ruby %}
def latitude_in_radians
  Math::PI * latitude / 180.0
end

def longitude_in_radians
  Math::PI * longitude / 180.0
end
{% endhighlight %}

And then use these methods in your index definition:

{% highlight ruby %}
has latitude_in_radians, as: :latitude, type: :float
has longitude_in_radians, as: :longitude, type: :float
{% endhighlight %}

#### SQL-backed Indices

For SQL-backed indices, you can have the degrees-to-radians conversion take place in your index definition instead:

{% highlight ruby %}
has "RADIANS(latitude)",  :as => :latitude,  :type => :float
has "RADIANS(longitude)", :as => :longitude, :type => :float

# If you're using PostgreSQL:
group_by 'latitude', 'longitude'
{% endhighlight %}

Once this is done, you'll need to rebuild your Sphinx indexes:

{% highlight sh %}
rake ts:rebuild
{% endhighlight %}

### Searching

Once your indexes are set up, then you can begin searching. You need to make sure you're doing two things:

* Provide a geographical reference point
* Filter or sort by the calculated distance

For the first, you can provide an array of two arguments (latitude and longitude, again in *radians*) to the `:geo` option. For the second, you'll need to refer to Sphinx's generated attribute `geodist` in a filter and/or a sort argument.

{% highlight ruby %}
# Searching for places within 10km
Place.search "pancakes", :geo => [@lat, @lng],
  :with => {:geodist => 0.0..10_000.0}
# Searching for places sorted by closest first
Place.search "pancakes", :geo => [@lat, @lng],
  :order => "geodist ASC, @relevance DESC"
{% endhighlight %}

If you do not provide any reference to `geodist`, then the lat/lng values will be ignored by Sphinx.

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Sphinx expects the latitude and longitude values to be in radians - so you will probably need to convert the values when searching.</p>
</div>

### Displaying Results

When you provide a `:geo` option to your search, the distance pane is automatically added to search results, and so you can access the calculated Sphinx distance through either the `distance` or `geodist` methods (your model's own methods of those names take precedence if they exist):

{% highlight erb %}
<% @places.each do |place| %>
  <li><%= place.name %>, <%= place.distance %></li>
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

It's worth noting that the distance is in metres - so those stuck on the Imperial system (Americans, that's you), you might want to convert to less archaic measurements.
