## Installing Thinking Sphinx

At the time of writing, Thinking Sphinx v5 supports ActiveRecord v4.2 through to v6.0. Installation instructions depend on whether you're using Rails or a different framework (such as Sinatra):

* [Rails 4.2 or newer](installing_thinking_sphinx/ts5.html)
* [Sinatra and Other Frameworks](installing_thinking_sphinx/sinatra.html)

Please refer to [the older documentation](../v4/installing_thinking_sphinx.html) for versions that support ActiveRecord 4.1 or earlier.
