## Installing Thinking Sphinx

At the time of writing, Thinking Sphinx v4 supports ActiveRecord v3.2 through to v5.2. Installation instructions depend on whether you're using Rails or a different framework (such as Sinatra):

* [Rails 3.2 or newer](installing_thinking_sphinx/ts4.html)
* [Sinatra and Other Frameworks](installing_thinking_sphinx/sinatra.html)

Please refer to [the older documentation](../v3/installing_thinking_sphinx.html) for versions that support ActiveRecord 3.1 or earlier.
